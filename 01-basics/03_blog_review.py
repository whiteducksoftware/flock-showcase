"""
Review Pipeline Showcase
========================

This example demonstrates a simple review pipeline using the Blackboard Orchestrator.
The blog writer agent generates a blog post based on an idea, and the SEO optimizer agent reviews it.
This again triggers the blog writer to improve the blog based on the review until a satisfactory review is achieved.
