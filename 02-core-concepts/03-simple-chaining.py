# 02-core-concepts/03-simple-chaining-alt.py
"""
Purpose: Demonstrate how to chain multiple agents together to solve complex tasks.

Use Case: Fantasy Character Adventure Generator üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüêâ - Create a character,
         generate an adventure, and narrate an epic conclusion.

Highlights:
- Chain multiple specialized agents together to build a complete workflow
- Each agent focuses on a specific task and passes its output to the next agent
- Show different ways to connect agents (default router, LLM router)
- Demonstrate how complex creative tasks can be broken down into manageable steps

# --- YOUR TURN! ---
# 1. Try with different character types:
#    - Change the example_character variable to "rogue", "paladin", "druid", etc.
#    - See how the entire adventure changes based on the initial input
#
# 2. Modify the agent chain:
#    - Add a new agent between Adventure and Conclusion (e.g., "battle_scene_generator")
#    - Update the chaining to include your new agent
#    - Adjust the inputs/outputs to pass the necessary information
#
# 3. Try different routing methods:
#    - Uncomment the LLMRouter lines and comment out the DefaultRouter lines
#    - This lets the LLM decide which agent to call next based on context
#    - Add a new agent that isn't in the main chain and see if the LLM router ever chooses it
#
# 4. Create a branching chain:
#    - Add two different conclusion agents (e.g., "happy_ending" and "tragic_ending")
#    - Use the LLM router to decide which ending to generate based on the adventure
#    - Hint: You'll need to define criteria for the router to consider
#
# 5. Add memory to the chain:
#    - Modify the agents to accept and pass along a "previous_adventures" parameter
#    - Create a character with multiple adventures that reference past events
