Purpose: Demonstrate the difference between Flock's declarative approach

Use Case: News Article Analyzer üì∞ - Extract structured data from news articles.

Highlights:
- The declarative approach defines the desired output structure using Pydantic models
- The traditional approach requires detailed instructions for each extraction step
- Both approaches extract the same information, but with different levels of complexity
- Shows how easy it is to modify and extend the declarative approach

OpenAI to remain under non-profit control in change of restructuring plans
By Reuters

Updated: 3:34 PM EDT, Mon May 5, 2025

Source: CNN

OpenAI said on Monday it would remain under the control of its nonprofit parent, while pushing ahead with plans to change the structure of its for-profit arm to allow more capital-raising to keep pace in the artificial-intelligence race.

The announcement follows a storm of criticism and legal challenges, including a high-profile lawsuit filed by rival Elon Musk, who has accused the company of straying from its founding mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity.

‚ÄúWe made the decision for the nonprofit to stay in control after hearing from civic leaders and having discussions with the offices of the Attorneys General of California and Delaware,‚Äù the startup said in a blog post. It added that it would work with major backer Microsoft, regulators and newly appointed nonprofit commissioners to finalize the updated plan.

The company had outlined plans in December to revamp its structure to become a public benefit corporation, saying that would help it to ‚Äúraise more capital than we‚Äôd imagined,‚Äù and remove the restrictions imposed on the startup by its current nonprofit parent.

The move had raised concerns about whether OpenAI would allocate its assets to the nonprofit arm fairly, and how the company would strike a balance between making a profit and generating social and public good as it develops AI.

On Monday, OpenAI said the nonprofit parent will control the public benefit corporation and become a big shareholder in it.

Nonprofits are created to serve the public good, while public benefit corporations typically offer more flexibility to pursue profit alongside social goals.

Bret Taylor, chairman of OpenAI‚Äôs board, said Monday‚Äôs announcement means the startup will continue to have a structure ‚Äúextremely close‚Äù to the current one.

CEO Sam Altman described it as a compromise ‚Äúthat (works) well enough for investors that they‚Äôre happy to continue to fund us to a degree we think we will need.‚Äù

As the expensive pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or AI that surpasses human intelligence, heats up, OpenAI has been looking to make changes to attract further investment.

It said in March it would raise up to $40 billion in a new funding round led by SoftBank Group at a $300 billion valuation. The round was contingent on the AI firm transitioning to for-profit status by the end of the year.

SoftBank and Microsoft did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Some analysts said the move could hamper the startup‚Äôs ability to raise capital as aggressively as it could have without the nonprofit control.

‚ÄúThe nonprofit status significantly reduces OpenAI‚Äôs ability to raise capital, as investors would want to be able to generate a return on their investment, which is considerably harder if a non-profit controls a commercial entity,‚Äù said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.

OpenAI‚Äôs structure drew attention in November 2023 during one of the biggest boardroom dramas in Silicon Valley, where members of the nonprofit board ousted Altman over a breakdown in communication and loss of trust. He was reinstated after five days, following an outpouring of support from employees and investors.

# 2. Modify the extraction requirements:
#    - For the declarative approach, add a new field to one of the Pydantic models
#      (e.g., add "tone: Literal['formal', 'casual']" to ArticleMetadata)
#    - For the traditional approach, add the same requirement to the detailed prompt
#    - Compare how much easier it is to modify the declarative approach
#
# 3. Add a new entity type:
#    - Create a new Pydantic model for something else to extract (e.g., Organizations)
#    - Add it to the ArticleAnalysis model
#    - Update the traditional prompt to extract the same information
#    - Compare the effort required for both approaches
#
# 4. Try extracting from multiple articles:
#    - Create a list of articles and run both approaches on each
#    - See how consistent the results are across different inputs
