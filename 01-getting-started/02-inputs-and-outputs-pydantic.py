# We claimed that flock doesn't care about prompts.
# This was a little bit of clickbait of course.
# Flock cares very much about prompts.
# But with flock you don't prompt the agent as a whole,
# but the properties of the input and output.
#
# General syntax rules:
# "field_name: type | description"
#
# If you need to specify the agents behavior, you can do so with the description field.

# YOUR TURN!
# Try changing the types and descriptions of the input and output fields
# What happens if agent description is at odds with the input and output fields?
