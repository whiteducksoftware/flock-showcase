# Spec-Driven Development with Flock

**A complete reimagination of devflow as a blackboard orchestration system.**

## 🎯 What Is This?

This example demonstrates how to implement a full spec-driven development workflow using Flock's blackboard architecture. Instead of rigid command-based orchestration, agents collaborate emergently through typed artifacts on the blackboard.

## 📊 Current Status: **86% Complete** (6/7 phases, Phase 6 skipped per user request)

### ✅ What's Working

**Phase 1: Artifact Types (COMPLETE)**
- 26 artifact types across 6 categories
- All types validated with Pydantic + `@flock_type`
- See: `artifacts.py`

**Phase 2: Specialist Agents (COMPLETE)**
- 19 specialist agents that react to specific artifact types
- 4 Research specialists (market, technical, security, UX)
- 4 Documentation specialists (PRD, SDD, PLAN, patterns)
- 4 Implementation specialists (backend, frontend, database, infrastructure)
- 4 Review & Validation specialists
- 3 Analysis specialists
- See: `agents.py`

**Phase 3: Orchestrators (COMPLETE)**
- 4 main orchestrators (specify, implement, analyze, refactor)
- 4 helper coordinators (research_aggregator, phase_validator, etc.)
- Uses JoinSpec for research batching
- Uses BatchSpec for phase execution
- See: `orchestrators.py`

**Phase 4: MCP Tool Integration (COMPLETE)**
- All 27 agents wired with appropriate MCP tools
- Filesystem MCP: For reading code and writing docs
- DuckDuckGo MCP: For web research
- Website Reader MCP: For deep content analysis
- Agent-specific tool access (research gets web, implementers get filesystem, etc.)
- See: `mcp_config.py`, `01_test_mcp_config.py`

**Phase 5: Example Implementation (COMPLETE)**
- Custom tools for spec management (`spec_tools.py`)
- **Specify workflow**: End-to-end PRD generation from feature description
- **Analyze workflow**: Pattern discovery through codebase analysis
- **Implement workflow**: Phase-by-phase execution with validation gates
- **Refactor workflow**: Safe, incremental code improvements
- All 4 core workflows working with real file I/O
- See: `02_specify_workflow.py`, `03_analyze_workflow.py`, `04_implement_workflow.py`, `05_refactor_workflow.py`

### 🚧 What's In Progress

- Full orchestrator implementations with review cycles
- Dashboard visualization (optional)
- Testing and validation (Phase 6)

## 🏃 Quick Start - Test the System!

> **🎯 NEW USER? START HERE!** Try the [Dashboard Demo (Test 7)](#test-7-dashboard-demo-new-) first!
> It's the most visual and impressive way to see 27 agents collaborating in real-time.

### Test 1: MCP Configuration

Verify that MCP tools are configured correctly:

```bash
cd examples/08-spec-driven-development
uv run python 01_test_mcp_config.py
```

This tests filesystem, web search, and website reader MCPs. **Prerequisites:**
- `npm` installed (for filesystem MCP)
- `uvx` installed (for DuckDuckGo MCP)

### Test 2: Specialist Agents

Run the specialist validation example:

```bash
cd examples/08-spec-driven-development
uv run python 00_test_specialists.py
```

**Note:** This will take several minutes as the LLM agents actually execute!

### Test 3: Specify Workflow (NEW!)

Generate a complete Product Requirements Document (PRD):

```bash
cd examples/08-spec-driven-development
uv run python 02_specify_workflow.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Creating spec directory with custom tools
- Research specialists executing in parallel
- Synthesizing findings into PRD sections
- Writing structured documentation to `.flock/specs/SXXX/PRD.md`

**Note:** This is a real end-to-end workflow! It will take 5-10 minutes.

### Test 4: Analyze Workflow (NEW!)

Discover patterns in a codebase:

```bash
cd examples/08-spec-driven-development
uv run python 03_analyze_workflow.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Pattern discovery through code analysis
- Multiple analysis specialists working in parallel
- Emergent knowledge extraction via blackboard
- Documentation generation from discovered patterns

### Test 5: Implement Workflow (NEW!)

Execute an implementation plan phase-by-phase:

```bash
cd examples/08-spec-driven-development
uv run python 04_implement_workflow.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Loading and parsing PLAN.md into phases
- Publishing ImplementationTask artifacts
- Routing tasks by activity_area (backend, frontend, database, infrastructure)
- Parallel execution within phases
- Validation gates (tests + build)
- PhaseComplete signal for workflow control

### Test 6: Refactor Workflow (NEW!)

Improve code quality with safety checks:

```bash
cd examples/08-spec-driven-development
uv run python 05_refactor_workflow.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Analyzing code for refactoring opportunities
- Incremental changes (one at a time)
- Validation after EVERY change (tests must pass)
- BlockedState if validation fails
- Safe, reversible refactoring pattern

### Test 7: Dashboard Demo (NEW! 🎯)

**Interactive dashboard visualization** - Choose your workflow and watch the magic!

```bash
cd examples/08-spec-driven-development
uv run python 06_dashboard_demo.py
```

This demonstrates:
- **Interactive workflow selection** (Specify, Analyze, Implement, or Refactor)
- **Real-time visualization** of 27 agents collaborating
- **Blackboard artifact flow** shown live
- **Agent execution graph** with dependencies
- Perfect for demos and presentations!

Choose from:
1. **Specify**: Watch 4 research specialists work in parallel, then see documentation emerge
2. **Analyze**: See 3 analyzers discover patterns simultaneously
3. **Implement**: Watch phase-by-phase execution with validation gates
4. **Refactor**: Observe incremental improvements with safety checks

**Pro tip**: This is the BEST way to understand how blackboard orchestration works!

### What You'll See

1. **Research Specialists in Parallel**
   - 4 research tasks published
   - All 4 specialists react simultaneously
   - 4 ResearchFindings artifacts created

2. **Documentation Flow**
   - ResearchFindings → PRDSection
   - PRDSection + ResearchFindings → SDDSection
   - Sequential building

3. **Implementation Routing**
   - Tasks routed by `activity_area` predicate
   - Backend, Frontend, Database, Infrastructure specialists
   - All execute in parallel

4. **Analysis Pattern Discovery**
   - AnalyzeRequest routed by `analysis_area`
   - PatternDiscovery artifacts created

```

### Key Design Decisions

**Why Hybrid Approach?**
- Orchestrators coordinate high-level workflow
- Specialists handle focused tasks
- Blackboard enables emergent collaboration

**Why JoinSpec for Research?**
- Multiple research tasks fire in parallel
- Orchestrator waits for ALL findings before documenting
- Mirrors devflow's "wait for all agents" pattern

**Why BatchSpec for Implementation?**
- Tasks within a phase can run in parallel
- Size threshold = all tasks in phase
- Timeout = safety valve for long-running tasks

## 🔄 Workflow Comparison

### Original DevFlow

```
User → /s:specify → Command Orchestrator → Task Agents (via prompts)
                     ↓
                  Uses natural language delegation
                  Agents read prompt files
                  Coordination via cycles
```

### Flock Implementation

```
User → SpecifyRequest → specify_orchestrator → ResearchTask (artifacts)
                         ↓                        ↓
                    Blackboard          research_* agents (subscriptions)
                         ↓                        ↓
                  PRDSection ← documenter_requirements
```

**Key Differences:**
- ❌ DevFlow: Natural language prompts, explicit delegation
- ✅ Flock: Typed artifacts, emergent subscriptions
- ❌ DevFlow: Command-based coordination
- ✅ Flock: Event-driven blackboard
- ❌ DevFlow: ~40 text files defining agents
- ✅ Flock: 19 declarative agent definitions
