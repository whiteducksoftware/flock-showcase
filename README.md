# 🦆 Flock Showcase 🦆

Welcome to the Flock examples! This directory contains a carefully curated learning path that takes you from your first "Hello World" agent to advanced multi-agent systems with security controls.

## 📁 Two Flavors: CLI and Dashboard

Each example comes in **two versions**:

- **`01-cli/`** - Run examples from the command line with detailed console output
- **`02-dashboard/`** - Launch the interactive web dashboard to visualize agent execution

Both versions demonstrate the same concepts, just with different interfaces. Start with CLI to see what's happening under the hood, then switch to dashboard to visualize complex multi-agent interactions.

## 🎓 Learning Path

The examples are ordered by complexity. Start at `01` and work your way up!

### 01 - Declarative Pizza 🍕

**Run it**:
```bash
# CLI version
uv run examples/01-cli/01_declarative_pizza.py

# Dashboard version

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install Flock**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Pick an example** (start with 01):
   ```bash
   uv run examples/01-cli/01_declarative_pizza.py
   ```

3. **Try the dashboard version**:
   ```bash
   uv run examples/02-dashboard/01_declarative_pizza.py
   ```

4. **Work through the examples in order** - each builds on concepts from the previous ones!

## 💡 Tips

- **Start with CLI** - See detailed output and understand what's happening
- **Switch to Dashboard** - Visualize complex multi-agent interactions
- **Read the code** - Each example is intentionally minimal and well-commented
- **Experiment** - Modify examples to see how Flock responds
- **Check traces** - After running example 11, explore `.flock/traces.duckdb`

## 🎯 Key Concepts Progression

```
Simple → Complex
Single Agent → Multi-Agent
Synchronous → Parallel
Unstructured → Structured
Local → External Tools
Open → Secured
```

## 📚 Next Steps

After completing these examples, you're ready to:
- Build your own multi-agent systems
- Integrate custom MCP servers
- Design complex agent workflows
- Implement security controls
- Debug with tracing

**Happy building! 🦆**
