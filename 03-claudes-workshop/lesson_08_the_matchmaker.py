üéì Lesson 08: The Matchmaker - Correlated AND Gates with JoinSpec

CONCEPT: Sometimes data arrives separately but needs to be processed together.
JoinSpec lets you correlate related artifacts (like matching orders with shipments)
and ensures they're processed as a unit.

REAL-WORLD USE CASE:
E-commerce fulfillment center needs to match customer orders with shipping updates.
Both happen independently, but customer service needs BOTH to provide accurate updates.

KEY LEARNING:
- JoinSpec creates "correlated AND gates" - match artifacts by a common key
- `by=lambda x: x.order_id` defines the correlation key
- `within=timedelta(hours=24)` sets the correlation time window
- Agent only triggers when BOTH correlated artifacts arrive

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Without JoinSpec, you'd need complex state management and matching logic.
With JoinSpec, the orchestrator handles correlation automatically!

PROGRESSION NOTE:
You've learned: single agents (L01), chaining (L02), predicates (L03),
feedback loops (L04), tracing (L05), visibility (L06), parallelism (L07).
NOW: Correlated data processing!
