üéì Lesson 10: The Smart Factory - Combining JoinSpec + BatchSpec

CONCEPT: The ultimate power move! Combine JoinSpec (correlation) with BatchSpec
(batching) to create sophisticated multi-stage processing pipelines. First correlate
related data, THEN batch the correlated groups for efficient bulk processing.

REAL-WORLD USE CASE:
Smart factory with IoT sensors monitors temperature + pressure for each machine.
Need to:
1. Correlate temp + pressure readings from SAME device (JoinSpec)
2. Batch 5 correlated device readings for bulk analysis (BatchSpec)
3. Generate quality control reports for manufacturing efficiency

KEY LEARNING:
- JoinSpec + BatchSpec work together seamlessly
- Flow: Publish ‚Üí Correlate (JoinSpec) ‚Üí Batch Groups (BatchSpec) ‚Üí Process
- BatchSpec batches GROUPS (correlated pairs), not individual artifacts
- Agent receives list of correlation groups, processes them in bulk

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Real-world systems often need BOTH:
- Medical: Correlate patient tests + images, batch 10 patients for radiologist
- Finance: Correlate trades + confirmations, batch 50 for reconciliation
- Logistics: Correlate shipments + manifests, batch 100 for customs processing

PROGRESSION NOTE:
This is THE advanced lesson! You've learned all the building blocks:
- L01-L02: Basic agents and chaining
- L03-L04: Predicates and feedback loops
- L05: Tracing and observability
- L06-L07: Visibility and parallelism
- L08: JoinSpec correlation
- L09: BatchSpec batching
NOW: Combine them for production-grade IoT processing!

    Phase 1: CORRELATION
    - Publish temp + pressure readings for 5 devices

    Phase 2: BATCHING
    - BatchSpec accumulates correlation groups
    - When 5 groups collected ‚Üí FLUSH!
    - Agent processes all 5 devices together

    Phase 3: TIMEOUT HANDLING
    - Publish 2 more devices (partial batch)
