üéì Lesson 09: The Batch Optimizer - Efficient Processing with BatchSpec

CONCEPT: Processing items one-at-a-time is inefficient. BatchSpec lets you
accumulate artifacts and process them in optimal batches - triggered by
either SIZE threshold or TIMEOUT, whichever comes first!

REAL-WORLD USE CASE:
Payment processor wants to batch transactions to reduce fees. Processing one
transaction costs $0.30, but batching 25 together costs only $0.10 each.
Savings: $0.20 √ó 25 = $5.00 per batch!

KEY LEARNING:
- BatchSpec(size=25, timeout=30s) means "batch 25 items OR wait 30 seconds"
- SIZE trigger: Batch flushes immediately when threshold reached
- TIMEOUT trigger: Partial batches flush after timeout (no items lost!)
- Agent receives list of artifacts, not individual items

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Batching is critical for:
- Cost optimization (transaction fees, API rate limits)
- Performance (bulk database writes, batch ML inference)
- Network efficiency (fewer HTTP requests)

PROGRESSION NOTE:
You've learned: chaining (L02), predicates (L03), correlation (L08).
NOW: Efficient batch processing with automatic flushing!
