"""
Combined Features: JoinSpec + BatchSpec for IoT Sensor Processing (Dashboard)

Real-world scenario: Smart factory monitors temperature and pressure sensors
from multiple machines. System correlates readings from same machine (JoinSpec),
then batches 5 correlated readings together for bulk analysis (BatchSpec).

This combines:
- JoinSpec: Correlate temp + pressure by device_id
- BatchSpec: Batch 5 correlated pairs for efficient processing

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features:
- Visualize sensor readings arriving
- Watch correlation matching (temp + pressure per device)
- See batch accumulation (5 devices)
- Monitor quality analysis reports
