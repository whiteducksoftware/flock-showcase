"""
BatchSpec Example: E-commerce Order Batch Processing (Dashboard)

Real-world scenario: Online store batches payment processing to reduce
transaction fees. Instead of processing one order at a time ($0.30/transaction),
batch 25 orders together for bulk discount ($0.10/transaction).

Cost savings: 25 orders Ã— $0.20 saved = $5.00 per batch!

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features:
- Watch orders accumulate in real-time
- See batch size threshold approaching
- Visualize cost savings per batch
- Monitor timeout-based flushes
